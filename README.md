## Repo for iProtDNA-SMOTE framework
This repo holds the code of iProtDNA-SMOTE framework for protein-ligands binding sites prediction. Five processed datasets are published, including TR646, TR573, TE46, TE129, and TE181.

iProtDNA-SMOTE is primarily dependent on a large-scale pre-trained protein language model ESM2 implemented using PyTorch. Please install the dependencies in advance.

## Files and folders description
### 1. Raw_data
This folder contains raw data. The first line is the protein id (which might not be PDB ID); the second line is the protein sequence, and the third line is the data label indicating binding sites or non-binding sites.

Note: if you wanna find the original data in PDB format, please kindly refer to the following 3 papers: DBPred, GraphBind, and GraphSite.

### 2. Graphs
This folder contains graph models for five datasets, where each node represents an amino acid residue. The node features are embeddings generated by ESM2. Distances between nodes are determined based on the three-dimensional structure of proteins, with a defined spatial distance threshold of 8 angstroms. If the distance between the CÎ± atoms of two residues is less than this threshold, they are connected by an edge in the graph model.

### 3. Weights
This folder contains trained weight files. Specifically, 646_46.pt corresponds to the trained model for task TR646, suitable for testing the TE46 dataset. 573_129.pt represents the trained model for task TR573, applicable for testing the TE129 dataset. Lastly, 573_181.pt denotes another trained model for task TR573, intended for testing the TE181 dataset.

## Codes description
The training and implementation of this project are based on PyTorch 1.11.0 and PyTorch-lightning 2.0.3, the higher version might not be compatible.
